maildir_merge_duplicates.py

Removes duplicate emails/files in a Maildir and merges their flags.

Duplicate emails in a Maildir can occur e.g. when restoring a backup. Maildir
stores its email flags in the filename itself. If an email status changes from
unread to read a ",S" is appended to the end of the filename.

Imagine now that something bad happened with your Maildir and some mails got
lost/deleted, but you don't know which ones. In a normal restore scenario you
would instruct your backup software to not overwrite existing files to make
sure that you don't destroy the changes on other files done since the last
backup.

In this case you will end up with lots of duplicate emails in the case that the
flags changed from the time of last backup. In fact you have overwritten
existing information - the messages status flags.

Another source of Maildir clutter might be a sync software that doesn't handle
the specifics of Maildirs. In either case you want to delete the duplicate
mails but you don't want to delete the "wrong" mails with the outdated flag
information.

maildir_merge_duplicates.py cannot magically know the original and the duplicate
message of course, but it can merge the flags of the duplicates and delete the
other message for you.
